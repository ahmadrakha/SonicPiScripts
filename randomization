1. Use three different methods to choose random notes from the 'notes' array.
2. DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE, just assign values to the variables 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
3. Use the blue values that print in the log to troubleshoot.
4. Use the '=begin' and '=end' to comment out the two strategies you are not currently working on!
